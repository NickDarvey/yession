module Yession.Browser.EditorHarness

// A host-free browser harness for the rich-editor E2E. Mounts a ProseMirror editor on a fresh
// Yjs fragment into `#host` and exposes its serialized Markdown as `window.__md`. There is NO
// Session Process, NO WebRTC and NO native addon here — just the editor and a doc — so the
// editor-rendering E2E (`Tag.needs [Browser]`) runs wherever Chromium exists, decoupled from
// `node-datachannel`. Pure F# (the no-authored-JS invariant holds); Fable-compiles alongside
// the app browser entry, and the `Browser`-cap test build esbuilds it into the served bundle.
//
// It also exercises presence cursors headlessly-but-in-a-browser: the editor reports its own
// selection (base64 relative anchor/head) through `reportFocus`; `window.__pushRemote(name)`
// feeds that same selection back in as a *remote* peer's cursor, so the on-screen decorations
// (the caret widget + label and the selection highlight) render for the E2E to assert on.
//
// Module-level `do` runs on import — module scripts are deferred, so `#host` already exists.
